      Gather all of the gaurdians to open the pyramid! Run over them with your character.
    </p>
      Press X to delete blocks ontop of you, and C to create blocks ontop of you. (inside the map)
    </p>
      WASD to move, arrows keys, q and e, or mouse to move camera. Shift and Space to move up and down.
    </p>
      Object loader was implemented for the intricate objects (on timeshare there is only 1 imported for performance its inside the pyramid).
    </p>
      Looks worse on timeshare because foliage had to be removed and images were compressed because performance is so bad on timeshare.
